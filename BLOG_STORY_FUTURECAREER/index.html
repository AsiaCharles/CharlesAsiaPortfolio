                Sa blog na 'to, nagsusulat ako ng letter para sa future self ko about being a college student. Naisip kong gawin 'to kasi lately na is stress na ako sa academic and the pressure. Sa stage ng life ko ngayon, parang I feel alot of pressure at minsan napapaisip ako kung makakagraudate pa ako. Curious ako kung nasaan na ako pag binasa mo na 'to. Sana maalala mo kung paano ka nagsimula.

                At this moment, I am a student who is trying to make sense of things. There are days when I am motivated and there are days when I am tired and fed up with school and expectations. Although it becomes tiresome, I continue to do it as I think that this stage is preparing my future. Procrastination is one of my greatest weaknesses that at times stops me. This way I have learnt that you do not necessarily have to make any perfect progress, just work and be consistent. Slowly, I am learning to trust myself and make one step at a time. Hopefully, future me, you will be more confident and nearer to the goals. Do not forget that everything the stress and the late nights were not in vain. Whichever part of the world you are in, remember your reason of joining it.

                Now that I am writing this letter, I know that I am stronger than I usually believe. I have also realised that whatever I am undergoing at this moment is all contributing to the person I am becoming. The lesson that I have learned personally is that growth is time-consuming, patient, and hard. Going on, I intend to continue challenging myself and to have faith in the process to ensure that in the end, I will be able to state that everything that I have undergone was justified.
